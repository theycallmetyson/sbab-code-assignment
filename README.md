# SBAB Code Assignment
## Challenge
The task is to write an application to find out which bus lines that have the most bus stops on their route, and to present the top 10 bus lines in a nice and formatted way in a web browser.
The web page should show the names of every bus stop for each of the bus lines in the top 10 list.
There are no requirements how the bus stops are sorted.
To accomplish the task please use the Trafiklabâ€™s open API (https://www.trafiklab.se/). You can find more information about the specific API on the documentation page: https://www.trafiklab.se/api/sl-hallplatser-och-linjer-2.
You can register your own account at Trafiklab.
The data should be automatically gathered from API for each run of the application.
## Language 
We would like you to use JavaScript for the front-end parts of the application and Java for the back-end.
You are free to choose the version of JavaScript and Java. 
You can use external libraries if you would like to.
## Delivery 
We would like you to share your code with us in advance so we can review it before we invite you to discuss the solution. 
The solution should include the source code and instructions to run the application in MacOS/Unix or Windows. The delivery method should be a link to the repository at any version control provider (Github, gitlab etc.).
